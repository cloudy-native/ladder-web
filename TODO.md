  - [ ] Simplify interfaces
- [ ] Change all imports to '@' notation
- [ ] No single statement block... everything inside {}
- [ ] In CRUDL exception handling, unify the error condition. Do we rethrow the error after the CRUDL operation? Or do we handle it with the same message in 2 places?
- [ ] Probably already covered this, but don't call playerClient() and other in the client coe. Always delegate to the encapsulations
